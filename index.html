  <h3> An Interest in Technology and Coding has Always Been in My Bones</h3>
  <p> Ever since I was young technology has always been a profound interest of mine. I have always been wanting to learn more and figure
    how to do certain things. If I wanted to do something I did not know how to do I had to research it and figure it out on my own. My 
    sister for example has always been able to ask me and I have been able to teach her. Being the oldest sibling and a mother with 
    absolutely no understanding of technology it has always been up to me.
